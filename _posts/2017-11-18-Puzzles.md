title: Fuzz puzzles
---

Are you ready to test your skills as a human fuzzer? Here's a collection of puzzles where the objective is to find an input that leads to the execution of what appears to be *dead code*. Most of these puzzles are inspired by rants about various language design choices found in comments on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) posts. 

## JavaScript

### Puzzle 1: Cyclic ordering

~~~javascript
function f(a, b, c) {
	if (a < b && b < c && c < a) {
		throw Error();
	}
}
~~~

**Goal**: Find values for `a`, `b` and `c` such that `f(a,b,c)` throws an error.

**Constraint**: All input values should be of primitive type (i.e. not objects or arrays).

### Puzzle 2: And but not Or

~~~javascript
function f(a, b) {
	if (a > b || a == b) {
		return true;
	} else if (a >= b) {
		throw Error();
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
~~~

**Goal**: Find values for `a` and `b` such that `f(a, b)` throws an error.

**Constraint**: All input values should be of primitive type (i.e. not objects or arrays).

### Puzzle 3: Sort descending by default

~~~javascript
function f(a, b) {
	var min = a <= b ? a : b;
	var max = a >= b ? a : b;
	var [first, second] = [a, b].sort();

	if (a != b && first === max && second === min) {
		throw Error();
	}
}
~~~

**Goal**: Find values for `a` and `b` such that `f(a, b)` throws an error.

**Constraint**: All input values should be of primitive type (i.e. not objects or arrays).

## Python

### Puzzle 4: To be and not to be
~~~python
def h(x, y):
  return x is y+1

def g(x):
  return h(x, x-1)

def f(x):
  if g(x) and not g(x+1):
    raise Exception()
~~~


**Goal**: Find a value for `x` such that `f(x)` raises an exception.

**Constraint**: The input value is of a primitive type (i.e. it is a number). Use the reference implementation of Python (aka CPython).

**Hint**: No solutions exist on some other implementations of Python such as [PyPy](https://pypy.org).
