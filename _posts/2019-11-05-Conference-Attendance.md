What can conference organizers do to minimize the impact of visa and travel restrictions on attendees, especially on student authors from developing nations?

To get a better idea of what some of the conferences in my field do, I embarked on an informal study. I scanned the websites of some conferences in my field or related areas for their policies regarding author attendance and visa issues. If I couldn't find any information on the website, I contacted the general chairs either via the web-based contact form, if present, or else via email. Here's what I found out.

There are several different inclusive strategies that conference organizers can consider (with overlaps between them):

* Implementing a policy for rotating conference venues around the world. [ICSE](http://www.icse-conferences.org) is one of the leaders in this space: the conference location continuously rotates between Europe, North America, and other continents. I was surprised to find that [only two conferences between ICSE 2014 and ICSE 2023](http://www.icse-conferences.org/history.html) were assigned a location in the USA, which is the most common host country for other conferences in this field.
* Choosing a conference venue in [a country that is welcoming to visitors](https://www.passportindex.org/byWelcomingRank.php). [ICLR 2020](https://iclr.cc/) has chosen to hold the conference in Ethiopia ([a rank #1 location](https://www.passportindex.org/comparebyDestination.php?p1=et&fl=&s=yes)). 
* Addressing the visa issue explicitly in the *Call for Papers* (CFP), and providing means of alternate presentation for affected authors of accepted papers. Such statements can help potential authors resolve worries about the risk of losing out on publication, should their travel be restricted after paper acceptance. 
	* [OOPSLA](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/OOPSLA/) and [POPL](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/POPL/) have been leaders in this space since 2017 and 2018 respectively, by supporting remote presentations. They have recently been joined by another SIGPLAN conference: [PLDI 2020](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers#accepted-papers).
	* Another strategy is to allow authors to present their work in person at a sister conference, usually held in a different country. [CSCW and ECSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/2019/submit-papers.html) are some of the leaders in this space.
* Support affected authors with alternate means of presentation (e.g. allowing someone else at the conference to present), without explicitly mentioning this on the website. I have been able to get official policies out-of-band from [ICSE 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2020) and [ASE 2019](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/) (see below).

## POPL

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x6), Portugal, France, India, Italy.

The [POPL 2018 Call for Papers](https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2018-papers#Call-for-Papers) itself had this statement (emphasis mine):

> **POPL welcomes all authors, regardless of nationality**. If authors are unable despite reasonable effort to obtain visas to travel to the conference, **arrangements to enable remote participation will be made**. In such cases, the general chair, Ranjit Jhala, should be contacted for guidance.

[POPL 2019](https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers?track=POPL%20Research%20Papers#publication-and-presentation-requirements) and [POPL 2020](https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#publication-and-presentation-requirements) have followed suit.

## OOPSLA

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x7), Greece, Canada, Netherlands. It is worth noting that OOPSLA has only been held outside of North America *twice* in its 35+ year history, the first one being in 2016!!

However, the [OOPSLA 2017](https://2017.splashcon.org/track/splash-2017-OOPSLA#information-for-authors-of-accepted-papers), [OOPSLA 2018](https://conf.researchr.org/track/splash-2018/splash-2018-OOPSLA#Instructions) and [OOPSLA 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/track/splash-2019/splash-2019-oopsla#information-for-authors-of-accepted-papers) Call for Papers have had a similar statement. I quote the one from 2019 below (emphasis mine):

> We welcome all authors to attend OOPSLA and present accepted papers, **regardless of nationality**. If any author has visa-related difficulties, we will make arrangements to enable **remote participation**.

## PLDI

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x6), UK (x2), Spain, China.

When I first started collecting data for this post, [PLDI 2020](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers) did not have any information about visa-related issues on their website. I used the contact form on the website to ask about this information. The [General Chair](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/profile/alastairdonaldson) and [Program Chair](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/profile/eminatorlak) responded soon: they [updated their CFP](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers#accepted-papers) to include the following statement (emphasis mine):

> PLDI welcomes all authors, **regardless of nationality**. If authors are unable despite reasonable effort to obtain visas to travel to the conference, we will make arrangements to enable **remote participation or presentation by another attendee** on behalf of the authors.

I'm glad that my poking around prompted this addition :-)

## ICFP

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x3), Germany, UK, Japan (x2), Canada, Sweden, Denmark.


The [ICFP 2020](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2020-papers) (to be held in New Jersey, USA) CFP currently states:

> At least one author of each accepted submissions will be expected to attend and present that paper at the conference. 

I could not find any information on their website about visa-related issues. I have inquired about their policy via email on November 3, and am still awaiting a response as of November 6.

Interestingly, this makes ICFP the only one of the four ACM SIGPLAN conferences that I surveyed to not address the visa issue in their CFP this year. 

However, ICFP's locations are the most diverse among these SIGPLAN conferences/


## ICST

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x2), Portugal, China, Sweden, Japan,  Austria, Luxembourg, Canada, Germany.

[ICST 2020](https://icst2020.info/track/icst-2020-papers#Call-for-Papers) will be held in Porto, Portugal. I could not find any information on their website regarding visa-related issues. I have inquired about their policy via the contact form on October 27, and am still awaiting a response as of November 6.

However, ICST appears to be located at a very diverse set of locations over the past ten years.


## ICSE

**Locations 2011–2020**: USA (x3), Korea, Canada, Sweden, Argentina, Italy, India, Switzerland.

Initially, I was pleased to find that ICSE 2020 (to be held in Seoul, South Korea) has a dedicated page on [diversity and inclusion](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2020/Diversity+and+Inclusion+Plan). This page reiterates the IEEE Computer Society's statement on, among other things, *equity*, which is defined as "*removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed*". Yet, there was no information on the website relating to barriers and obstacles in the form of visa requirements and denials, respectively. I therefore sent an email requesting an official policy on the possibility of remote presentations for affected authors of accepted papers. I received a detailed response from an [ICSE 2020 General Co-Chair](https://conf.researchr.org/profile/icse-2020/gregrothermel), who is also a member of the ICSE Steering Committee.

I learned that the visa issue is something that the ICSE Steering Committee is sensitive to:

> First, the ICSE Steering Committee is going to discuss this issue in it's November [2019] meeting, so there may well be an official over-arching position after that.

The rest of the response, concerning only the ICSE 2020 edition in particular, follows (emphasis mine):

> **For 2020, ICSE in general won't support remote presentations**, because we believe that the most powerful thing a conference offers is community and the ability to interact with others directly and in person. Moreover, the costs of running a conference make it important that people attend, as well.  For this reason, ICSE 2020 also does require (and this has been true of all ICSEs in the past decade) that at least one author of a paper register for and attend the entire conference. [...] **If no author of a given accepted paper registers for the conference, the paper is withdrawn from the proceedings and does not appear in any digital library**.   The same will occur if an author registers, but then, nobody appears in person at the conference to present the paper.
>
>  This all said, [...], if an author of an accepted paper were to register for ICSE 2020, and **due to visa problems could not attend**, and if they could provide evidence that they had made every effort (including acting in a timely manner) to obtain a visa, **we'd likely try to find a way to accommodate them**.

ICSE's trend of rotating conference venues between continents is worth noting. 

## ASE

**Locations 2010–2019**: USA (x5), France, Singapore, Sweden, Germany, Belgium.

Similar to ICSE, I found a page on the ASE 2019 website on [Diversity and Inclusion](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/attending/diversity-and-inclusion). I contacted the *Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Chairs* inquiring about the possibility of remote presentation for authors who could not attend the conference due to travel restrictions. My email was forwarded to [the General Chair](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/profile/tomzimmermann), who provided the following response (emphasis mine):

> We offer authors two options:
>
> a. **Record a video that we play back for presentation**. We do not allow live remote presentation to minimize the risk of technical issues. We do allow **live Q&amp;A via Skype**. If time zone differences or technical issues prevent a live Q&amp;A, we can collect questions at the end of talks and send to authors for follow-up.
> 
> b. **Presentation by a colleague** can present (who has to be registered; registrations by the non-attending author can be transferred to the presenting colleague). **The colleague does not have to be a co-author**. The colleague can collect questions at the end of the talk and send to the authors for follow up.

The [full response, to four specific questions that I had asked, can be found here](https://blog.padhye.org/ase-2019-response-on-visa-issues).

## CSCW

The [CSCW 2019](https://cscw.acm.org/2019/submit-papers.html) statement is one of the most inclusive ones that I have seen. It explicitly addresses (a) paper publication in the proceedings, (b) remote presentation, and (c) presentation at alternate locations.

> The conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. **Such papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration status, and we will seek ways for authors to present their work remotely at the conference**.
>
> The presenting author of an accepted CSCW 2019 paper who is unable to attend due to legal travel barriers (like the US travel ban) **may apply to present at ECSCW 2020 instead**. Please be in touch with the paper chairs if you are eligible and would like to explore this option.
>
> Reciprocally, CSCW 2019 will accommodate presentations of work accepted to ECSCW 2019 in case there are authors prevented from traveling to ECSCW because of legal travel barriers.

It is worth noting that the first paragraph also appeared in the CFP of [CSCW 2018](https://cscw.acm.org/2018/submit/papers.html).


## CHI

## SOSP

## Overarching statements (ACM and IEEE)

Since many conferences are sponsored by ACM SIGs and IEEE societies, I also wanted to highlight relevant statements from some of these bodies.

[IEEE Computer Society's EDI statement](https://www.computer.org/about/vision): (emphasis mine)

> Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its activities. **Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed**. Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity.
> 
> **A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination.** [...]

[ACM SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/conferences/organizer-resources/organising-a-sigchi-sponsored-or-co-sponsored-conference/): (emphasis mine)

> SIGCHI strives to be inclusive for all its members and potential members. **Conference committees should consider conditions that might prohibit or exclude members of our community participating when making site selections.**
