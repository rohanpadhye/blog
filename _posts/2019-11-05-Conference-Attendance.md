What can conference organizers do to minimize the impact of visa and travel restrictions on attendees, especially on student authors from developing nations?

To get a better idea of what some of the conferences in my field do, I embarked on an informal study. I scanned the websites of some conferences in my field or related areas for their policies regarding author attendance and visa issues. If I couldn't find any information on the website, I contacted the general chairs either via the web-based contact form, if present, or else via email. Here's what I found out.

There are several different strategies that I have seen (with overlaps):

* Implementing a policy for rotating conference venues around the world. [ICSE](http://www.icse-conferences.org) is one of the leaders in this space: the conference location continuously rotates between Europe, North America, and other continents. I was surprised to find that [only two conferences between ICSE 2014 and ICSE 2023](http://www.icse-conferences.org/history.html) were assigned a location in the USA, which is the most common host country for other conferences in this field.
* Choosing a conference venue in [a country that is welcoming to visitors](https://www.passportindex.org/byWelcomingRank.php). [ICLR 2020](https://iclr.cc/) has chosen to hold the conference in Ethiopia ([a rank #1 location](https://www.passportindex.org/comparebyDestination.php?p1=et&fl=&s=yes)). 
* Addressing the visa issue explicitly in the *Call for Papers* (CFP), and providing means of alternate presentation for affected authors of accepted papers. Such statements can help potential authors resolve worries about the risk of losing out on publication, should their travel be restricted after paper acceptance. 
	* [OOPSLA](https://conf.researchr.org/series/OOPSLA) and [POPL](https://conf.researchr.org/series/POPL) have been leaders in this space since 2017 and 2018 respectively, by supporting remote presentations. They have recently been joined by another SIGPLAN conference: [PLDI 2020](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers#accepted-papers).
	* Another strategy is to allow authors to present their work in person at a sister conference, usually held in a different country. [CSCW and ECSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/2019/submit-papers.html) are some of the leaders in this space.
* Support affected authors with alternate means of presentation (e.g. allowing someone else at the conference to present), without explicitly mentioning this on the website. I have been able to get official policies out-of-band from [ICSE 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2020) and [ASE 2019](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/) (see below).

## POPL 2018–2020

The [POPL 2018 Call for Papers](https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2018-papers#Call-for-Papers) itself had this statement (emphasis mine):

> **POPL welcomes all authors, regardless of nationality**. If authors are unable despite reasonable effort to obtain visas to travel to the conference, **arrangements to enable remote participation will be made**. In such cases, the general chair, Ranjit Jhala, should be contacted for guidance.

[POPL 2019](https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers?track=POPL%20Research%20Papers#publication-and-presentation-requirements) and [POPL 2020](https://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#publication-and-presentation-requirements) have followed suit.

## OOPSLA 2017–19

The [OOPSLA 2017](https://2017.splashcon.org/track/splash-2017-OOPSLA#information-for-authors-of-accepted-papers), [OOPSLA 2018](https://conf.researchr.org/track/splash-2018/splash-2018-OOPSLA#Instructions) and [OOPSLA 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/track/splash-2019/splash-2019-oopsla#information-for-authors-of-accepted-papers) Call for Papers have had a similar statement. I quote the one from 2019 below:

> We welcome all authors to attend OOPSLA and present accepted papers, regardless of nationality. If any author has visa-related difficulties, we will make arrangements to enable remote participation.

## PLDI 2020

When I first started my survey, [PLDI 2020](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers) did not have any information about visa-related issues on their website. I used the contact form on the website to ask about this information. The General Chair and PC chair immediately [updated their CFP](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-papers#accepted-papers) to include the following statement (yay!):

> PLDI welcomes all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are unable despite reasonable effort to obtain visas to travel to the conference, we will make arrangements to enable remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

## ICFP 2020

[ICFP 2020](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2020-papers) will be held in Jersey City, United States. The CFP currently states:

> At least one author of each accepted submissions will be expected to attend and present that paper at the conference. 

I could not find any information on their website about visa-related issues. I have inquired about their policy via email on November 3, and am still awaiting a response as of November 6.

Interestingly, this makes ICFP the only one of the four flagship ACM SIGPLAN conferences to not address the visa issue in their CFP.

## ICST 2019

[ICST 2019](https://icst2020.info/track/icst-2020-papers#Call-for-Papers) wil be held in Porto, Portugal. I could not find any information on their website regarding visa-related issues. I have inquired about their policy via the contact form on October 27, and am still awaiting a response as of November 6.


## ICSE 2020

I got the following response from the general chair of ICSE 2020.

The following applies only to 2020 edition of ICSE (emphasis mine):

> For 2020, ICSE in general **won't support remote presentations**, because we believe that the most powerful thing a conference offers is community and the ability to interact with others directly and in person. Moreover, the costs of running a conference make it important that people attend, as well.  For this reason, ICSE 2020 also does require (and this has been true of all ICSEs in the past decade) that at least one author of a paper register for and attend the entire conference. [...] If no author of a given accepted paper registers for the conference, **the paper is withdrawn from the proceedings and does not appear in any digital library**.   The same will occur if an author registers, but then, nobody appears in person at the conference to present the paper.
>
>  This all said, [...], if an author of an accepted paper were to register for ICSE 2020, and **due to visa problems could not attend**, and if they could provide evidence that they had made every effort (including acting in a timely manner) to obtain a visa, **we'd likely try to find a way to accommodate them**.

I was also informed about potential updates to the overall policy for all of ICSE.

> [The] ICSE Steering Committee is going to discuss this issue in it's November [2019] meeting, so there may well be an official over-arching position after that.

## ASE 2019


I contacted the ASE 2019 organizing committee about the visa-related issue, and received the following response from [Tom Zimmerman, the General Chair](https://2019.ase-conferences.org/profile/tomzimmermann):

> We offer authors two options:
>
> a. Record a video that we play back for presentation. We do not allow live remote presentation to minimize the risk of technical issues. We do allow live Q&A via Skype. If time zone differences or technical issues prevent a live Q&A, we can collect questions at the end of talks and send to authors for follow-up.
> 
> b. Presentation by a colleague can present (who has to be registered; registrations by the non-attending author can be transferred to the presenting colleague). The colleague does not have to be a co-author. The colleague can collect questions at the end of the talk and send to the authors for follow up.

The [full response, to four specific questions that I had asked, can be found here](https://blog.padhye.org/ase-2019-response-on-visa-issues).

## CSCW 2019

The [CSCW 2019](https://cscw.acm.org/2019/submit-papers.html) statement is one of the most inclusive ones that I have seen. It explicitly addresses (a) paper publication in the proceedings, (b) remote presentation, and (c) presentation at alternate locations.

> The conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. **Such papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration status, and we will seek ways for authors to present their work remotely at the conference**.
>
> The presenting author of an accepted CSCW 2019 paper who is unable to attend due to legal travel barriers (like the US travel ban) **may apply to present at ECSCW 2020 instead**. Please be in touch with the paper chairs if you are eligible and would like to explore this option.
>
> Reciprocally, CSCW 2019 will accommodate presentations of work accepted to ECSCW 2019 in case there are authors prevented from traveling to ECSCW because of legal travel barriers.

It is worth noting that the first paragraph also appeared in the CFP of [CSCW 2018](https://cscw.acm.org/2018/submit/papers.html).


## Overarching statements (ACM and IEEE)

Since many conferences are sponsored by ACM SIGs and IEEE societies, I also wanted to highlight relevant statements from some of these bodies.

[IEEE Computer Society's EDI statement](https://www.computer.org/about/vision): (emphasis mine)

> Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its activities. **Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed**. Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity.
> 
> **A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination.** [...]

[ACM SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/conferences/organizer-resources/organising-a-sigchi-sponsored-or-co-sponsored-conference/): (emphasis mine)

> SIGCHI strives to be inclusive for all its members and potential members. **Conference committees should consider conditions that might prohibit or exclude members of our community participating when making site selections.**
